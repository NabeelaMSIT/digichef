The success of version 1 of our protype within the set deadlines is testament to the groups
dedication. This achievement also provides valuable affirmation to the set timeplan and the project 
specification. Having overcome the initial hurdle of acquiring a feel of the technologies involved,
the group can look forward to expanding version 1 to versions 2 and 3.
